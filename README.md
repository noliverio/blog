# blog
## Reason for the project
I wanted to have a blog for my website, but I didn't really like the options that I had through my provider. If I was going to need to have the blog hosted by another service anyway I figured to just go the next step and roll my own blog application and give it the features that I wanted and only those features.

## Blog supports

* posting from one user
* a heavily modified and simplified markdown
* automaticly generated post specific urls
